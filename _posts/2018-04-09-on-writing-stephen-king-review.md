I don't know what to say about the book in the introduction, because the title is, pretty much, self explanatory. However, I'd
like to mention that I've written down some key points from his book.

Also, it's two big sections -- the first one with his memories and bio and the second one is with his advices for wanna be writers.

<!--excerpt-->

Stephen uses an analogy with a toolbox for a writer filled with stuff to explain his vision of how to be good at the craft.

The toobox has few layers:

* vocabulary

* the grammar

	* avoid passive tense
	* avoid adverbs

* style

	* paragraphs are the basic unit of writing, you should pay attention to organizing it well

Also he says you should read a lot and write a lot to be a good writer.

And he points out there're bad writers, competent writers, good writers and geniuses. It's impossible to become a competent writer for a bad one and it's equally impossible for a good one to become a genius. But it's possible with a lot of work and dedication for a competent one to become a good one.

He says that every day he writes 2000 words.

Dialogs should be honest, written in the way real people talk. To be good at it, a writer should listen to how people talk and be able to reproduce their accents and other stuff on the paper.

King mentions that he has two drafts and one polish before letting a book out. And that at first he writes as fast as he can.

Then after he advices to put away the book for few weeks and then go and do fixes. Also he advices to show the book to few close people so that they could tell what's good and bad in it.

Second draft equals the first one minus ten percent.

Writing classes aren't necessary and could even hurt.

It's nice to avoid too much of a detailed research.
