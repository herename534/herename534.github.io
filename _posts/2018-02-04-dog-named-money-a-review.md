This book seems to target kids but could be useful for adults as well. It has lots of tips how to
handle finances wrapped around in a fairy tale type of story about a little girl and her dog.

The approach proposed is rather a careful one and very wise in the nature. I wrote down some nice advices and
I'd recommend reading it to almost anybody, especially, to people who may have problems in the financial 
life.

<!--excerpt-->

- Write down what you want to buy or achieve
- Choose the most important stuff if you wrote too much
- Break down the income into categories for saving, keep the amount within 3
- Make an album with pictures of the wishes
- Make a diary where you write down successes every day to gain confidence and to see the progress
- Think of good ideas of how to make money
- To earn a lot of money, solve peoples' problems by doing what you know how to do
- If you decided something you should set it up within 72 hours if you don't do it then you probably would never do it
- Take no loans or credits
- Save as much as it's possible
- Use a part of the savings to bring money by lending it or investing it. Keep a part of the money at home, another part at the bank
- Invest in stocks, for that you should choose a nice international investment fund that has existed for at least 10 years
- It makes sense to also count the inflation rate to see how the actual value of the money changes
- Some investments might not be worth time because they would not cover the inflation rate
- Delegate doing things you don't like to others
- Do statistics on finances
