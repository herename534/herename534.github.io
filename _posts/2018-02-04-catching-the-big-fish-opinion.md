The book is strange to me because I don't really like the ideas in it about meditating. Lynch talks about it on almost every page, bringing it up again and again.

The book is quite short, also it left me with a feeling that the thinking, expressed in it is just too strange, too abstract for me.

I can understand his interest in art, painting and film making. But the arguments used throughout it about meditation seem pretty much like some stuff you could find in a spiritual book.
