#### Opinion:

Finally went through the book. It also has a corresponding course online, a really popular one.


The book tells about basics of learning, but uses really nice, simple analogies to explain stuff. I envy
a lot middle school kids, who would read it. I wish, I had something like that when I was 12-15.


But even now, there're things to pick up for me, for example, I used to treat breaks during working or
learning as somethings bad, more like a distruction etc.

<!--excerpt-->

#### Summary:

* A key to successful learning, in a lot of ways, is about **switching between the "diffiuse" mode
and the "focused" mode**.


| type of the mode | learning style              | results     | corresponding hemisphere |
|:----------------:|:--------------:             |:-------:    |:------------------------:|
| focused          | intentional focus           | connecting things together, regular learning, solving problems you're familiar with or that don't take connecting of unusual things  |        left                  |
| diffused         | learning on the  background |  insights, cracking hard issues that require intuition or non standart approach                                                     |        right         |

* **Switching** from the focused mode to the diffused mode **could be done with walking, running or other
mechanical activities that keep you busy, but set your mind free to connect things
together**, to analyse the problem on the background.

* As it follows from the previous statement, **taking a break sometimes is crucial for figuring out
deeper connections with the subject**, regardless of what it's.

* Everyone has a different learning speed in different subjects, it's normal.
A practical application is to **not let that bring you down when you see you see someone being faster than you
in a certain subject**. Or when you feel frustrated that you can, let's say,
learn music faster than how to cook.

* **Persistance in a lot of ways  is more important than intellegence**. You don't know
your real potential.
There're many examples in the history of science,
when a guy made a huge impact on human's knowledge and was kind of a fuckup in the school.

* **Sleep** is also really important as it **refreshes the brain**.

* Anatomical and physiological **basis of learning is a neuron** connected to other
neurons with an **axon**. Neuron has also  **dendrites**. The connection between the two cells
is called a **synaps**.

* **During breaks and sleep** there's a process of **building and solidifying neural structures**, the
connections among the neurons.

* Move the items you learn from the shortterm memory to the longterm memory by **practice**
and **spaced repetitions**.

* Use **methaphors**, **visualizing** and the **muscle memory** to speed up learning.
> My opinion: muscle memory aka typing or writing down what you heard, especially
> if there's a lot to remember, really helps. But if you've already grasped an idea,
> if you writing down something you already understood.

  > Methaphors help as well, but I don't do it as much, a lot of times, it's just
  > easier to get things as they're.

  > About visializing, I think, some ideas are better to express with text, some look
  > really great in tables. For some of them, visualizing works really amazing.

  > Supposibly, the Einstein's love to visualizing and mind experiments could have been
  > stimulated by the ideas of Aaron Bernstein, a guy, who emphasized
  > importance of learning through pictures.

* Use the **memory palace technic**, which is, basically, you pick a place you know really well
and you try to connect ideas, concepts you learning to the place by imagining a walk through
the place (let's say, a room). You can do it by imagining unusual, crazy situations happening
in the room, because a mind remembers better things that caused emotions.
> My opinion: I don't like mnemotechnics in general, sometimes it could be useful,
> but most of the time, you've to spend more effort in order to create an unusual, memorable
> scene than just straight learning a concept.

* Use the **Feynman technic**, which is trying to explain a concept, a sophisticated one in simple
terms, better as simple as it's possible.

* **Retrieval is better than passive rereading** for keeping the material.

* Also, in addition to the basic idea that you should be understanding and practicing, **it's crucial
to work on getting a context, the big picture** besides the idea. Of how it relates with the other
ideas.

* To fight with **procrastination**, the author advices to see it as a **habbit**. Each habbit could
have 4 aspects:
  1. A belief;

  2. A trigger;

  3. A routine;

  4. A reward;

  So, a work on **forming habbits** might also include a certain **reward**, you should reward yourself
  for good habbits.

* The book suggests **tracking your time** with Pomodorro.
> My opinion: I used it, but have come to the conclusion,
> short sessions aren't working as good for me as just a simple stopwatch in my emacs on the
> background.

* **Plan you activity** ahead of the time, it's better to do it in the evening before.
> My opinion: I've tried both --
> making todo lists in the evening before or in the morning during the day. It seems, both work fine,
> I prefer making them in the evening, but sometimes I get so tired that I just put it off until
> the next morning.

* **Brainstorm together with others** to crack a hard problem, collaborations are really effective,
because often qualified others can see things you can't.
